Neural activation patterns in response to different stimuli become less distinct with age—a phenomenon known as neural dedifferentiation. Prior work suggests that declines in GABA, the brain’s main inhibitory neurotransmitter, may contribute to this effect, as lower GABA levels are linked to lower neural distinctiveness. To explore this, we adapted an existing computational model of koniocortex by modulating its shunting inhibition to simulate individual differences in GABA levels. We then measured neural distinctiveness in the model's output layer using cosine similarity. Model results showed that cosine similarity predicted fMRI-based neural distinctiveness and significantly mediated the relationship between GABA levels and distinctiveness. This provides a computational explanation for how age-related GABA decline may cause neural dedifferentiation.
