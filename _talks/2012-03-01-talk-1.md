**Age-related hearing loss** is characterized by reduced speech intelligibility in complex acoustic environments. Previous studies have reported that individual differences in levels of the inhibitory neurotransmitter **gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)** in the auditory cortex are associated with individual differences in auditory function. However, the impact of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, as well as the ratio of glutamate to GABA (E/I balance), on auditory function is still unclear. In the present work, we used MEGA-PRESS magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data to estimate GABA and **Glutamate/Glutamine (Glx)** concentration in the auditory cortex and found that the both GABA and GLX correlated with auditory performance.
