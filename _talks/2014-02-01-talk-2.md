Numerous neuroimaging studies have reported age-related changes in **resting-state** **functional**
**connectivity**. Many studies have reported lower within-network connectivity and higher between-
network connectivity in older vs. younger adults, suggested that resting state networks become
less segregated with age. However, most of these findings were from cross-sectional studies
and are potentially confounded by differences between the age groups other than age itself
(e.g., differences in education, in nutrition, in life experiences, etc.). We collected longitudinal
resting-state fMRI data from healthy older adults (65 years old and older) at two time points
about five years apart and used the CONN toolbox to estimate longitudinal changes in
functional connectivity within each participant. We estimated functional connectivity within and
between large-scale networks defined using the Harvard-Oxford atlas, including the Default
Mode, Sensorimotor, Visual, Salience, Dorsal Attention, FrontoParietal, Language, and
Cerebellar networks. In contrast to previous cross-sectional results, we found that between-
network connectivity tended to decline, not increase, in magnitude with age. We also failed to
find significant changes in within-network connectivity in most resting-state networks. These
findings raise doubts about the hypothesis that between-network connectivity increases with
age and once again demonstrate the importance of longitudinal studies in aging research.
