Numerous neuroimaging studies have reported age-related changes in **resting-state** **functional**
**connectivity**. Many studies have reported lower within-network connectivity and higher between-
network connectivity in older vs. younger adults, suggested that resting state networks become
less segregated with age. We estimated functional connectivity within and
between large-scale networks defined using the Harvard-Oxford atlas, including the Default
Mode, Sensorimotor, Visual, Salience, Dorsal Attention, FrontoParietal, Language, and
Cerebellar networks. In contrast to previous cross-sectional results, we found that between-
network connectivity tended to **decline**, not increase, in magnitude with age. We also failed to
find significant changes in within-network connectivity in most resting-state networks. These
findings raise doubts about the hypothesis that between-network connectivity increases with
age and once again demonstrate the importance of longitudinal studies in aging research.
