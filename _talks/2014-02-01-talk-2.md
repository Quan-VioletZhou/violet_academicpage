Numerous neuroimaging studies have reported age-related changes in **resting-state** **functional**
**connectivity**. Many cross-sectional studies suggested that resting state networks become
less segregated with age. We estimated functional connectivity within and
between large-scale networks in a longitudinal design. In contrast to previous cross-sectional results, we found that between-
network connectivity tended to decline, not increase, in magnitude with age. We also failed to
find significant changes in within-network connectivity in most resting-state networks. These
findings raise doubts about the hypothesis that between-network connectivity increases with
age and once again demonstrate the importance of longitudinal studies in aging research.
