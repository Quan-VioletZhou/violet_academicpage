**Psychology 240: Introduction to Cognitive Psychology**

**Course Description**. The field of Cognitive Psychology includes the psychology of
human perception, attention, memory, language, thinking (including problem
solving and reasoning), and consciousness. The material in this course will include
data and theory about the relationship between cognition, brain function, and
computation. The course will emphasize not only the content represented by these
topics, but also the processes by which researchers develop theories and collect
evidence.
