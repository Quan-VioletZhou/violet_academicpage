### âœ¨ About Me
Hi there! Iâ€™m **Quan (Violet) Zhou**, a second-year Ph.D. researcher in the fascinating field of **cognition and cognitive neuroscience**.

My work leverages **fMRI**, **MRS**, **deep neural networks**, and **machine learning** in computational modeling to explore cognitive aging.

### ðŸ“ˆ Research Interests
By day (and sometimes night), I explore the mysteries of the aging brain in [**Dr. Thad Polkâ€™s lab**](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/polklab/) at the **University of Michigan**. My work leverages **fMRI**, **MRS**, **deep neural networks**, and **machine learning** in computational modeling to explore **cognitive aging**.  

*Spoiler: itâ€™s not all about forgetting where you put your keys!*

### ðŸ’» Work Experience
Before diving into neuroscience, I worked as a systems engineer, developing real-time diagnostic systems and mastering distributed computing. Now, Iâ€™m combining that engineering expertise with my passion for cognitive science to explore big questions about how our brains adapt over time.

### ðŸŽ® My Other Worlds
When Iâ€™m not decoding the brainâ€™s secrets, I like to explore *other* complex worlds. As a dedicated gamer, Iâ€™ve learned **resilience** from *Elden Ring*, **strategic thinking** from *League of Legends*, and the importance of good hardware (*and caffeine*) from long nights in *Cyberpunk 2077*. Occasionally, I even take gaming into the lab with the **Meta VR system**â€”where virtual reality meets research reality.

Take a look around to explore my publications, projects, research, and a sprinkle of wit. Letâ€™s connectâ€”whether itâ€™s to discuss **science**, **tech**, or the **mysteries of life**!  

Whether itâ€™s neural networks or gaming networks, Iâ€™m always on a quest for knowledge, connection, and the next great adventure. Take a look around, and letâ€™s geek out together over science, tech, or gaming tips (just donâ€™t ask me how many times Iâ€™ve died to Malenia)!
