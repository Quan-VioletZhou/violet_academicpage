Hi there! Iâ€™m Quan (Violet) Zhou, a second-year Ph.D. researcher in the fascinating field of cognition and cognitive neuroscience. 

By day (and sometimes night), I explore the mysteries of the aging brain in [Dr. Thad Polkâ€™s lab](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/polklab/) at the University of Michigan. My work leverages fMRI, MRS, deep neural networks, and machine learning in computational modeling to explore cognitive aging. Spoiler: itâ€™s not all about forgetting where you put your keys!

Before diving into neuroscience, I worked as a systems engineer, developing real-time diagnostic systems and mastering distributed computing. Now, Iâ€™m combining that engineering expertise with my passion for cognitive science to explore big questions about how our brains adapt over time. When Iâ€™m not in the lab or wrangling datasets, Iâ€™m probably pondering how to make research more inclusive, brewing coffee, or just being endlessly curious about the world.

When Iâ€™m not decoding the brainâ€™s secrets, I like to explore other complex worlds. As a dedicated gamer, Iâ€™ve learned resilience from Elden Ring, strategic thinking from League of Legends, and the importance of good hardware (and caffeine) from long nights in Cyberpunk 2077. Occasionally, I even take gaming into the lab with the Meta VR systemâ€”where virtual reality meets research reality.

Take a look around to explore my projects, research, and a sprinkle of wit. Letâ€™s connectâ€”whether itâ€™s to discuss science, tech, or the mysteries of life!

Whether itâ€™s neural networks or gaming networks, Iâ€™m always on a quest for knowledge, connection, and the next great adventure. Take a look around, and letâ€™s geek out together over science, tech, or gaming tips (just donâ€™t ask me how many times Iâ€™ve died to Malenia)!
