title: "GABA levels decline with age: A longitudinal study"

permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'This study used a longitudinal design with MR spectroscopy to measure GABA levels in bilateral auditory, sensorimotor, and ventrovisual brain regions in 30 healthy older adults over two time points. Unlike previous cross-sectional studies, this approach allowed the researchers to track within-subject changes in GABA over time while controlling for age-related tissue atrophy using two common correction strategies. The goal was to clarify whether GABA declines with age independent of structural brain changes.'
