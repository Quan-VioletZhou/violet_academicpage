excerpt: 'This book chapter reviews the phenomenon of age-related neural dedifferentiation, in which neural activation patterns become less distinct in older adults. It summarizes evidence that dedifferentiation occurs across multiple brain regions and task types and can be measured using both task-based and resting-state neuroimaging. The chapter also explores potential causes—such as reduced neural responsivity and declines in neurotransmitters like dopamine and GABA—and discusses its behavioral consequences, including declines in memory, fluid cognition, and processing speed.'
