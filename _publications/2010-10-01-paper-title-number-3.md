excerpt: 'Recent research has used resting-state fMRI to investigate how programming experience shapes brain organization. Analyzing data from 150 participants, including 96 programmers, the study found that programmers showed increased connectivity among brain regions related to language, math, and temporal attention, while non-programmers showed stronger connectivity in social and emotional regions. Additionally, more programming experience was linked to reduced connectivity between visual and articulation-related regions, suggesting a refinement of processing networks with expertise.'
